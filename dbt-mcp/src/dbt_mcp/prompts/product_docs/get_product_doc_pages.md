Retrieve the Markdown content of one or more dbt documentation pages from docs.getdbt.com. Pass a list of URLs or relative paths (e.g. from search_product_docs results). Up to 5 pages can be fetched per call; pages are fetched in parallel for speed. Pass the optional `query` parameter to retrieve only the most relevant sections of each page rather than the full content — this significantly reduces response size and is recommended when you already know what topic you are looking for.

IMPORTANT — how to present docs content to the user:
1. Give a direct answer first, then explain. Don't just summarize — be specific about WHERE to find a feature in the UI and HOW it works.
2. Structure around the user's task: lead with what they asked, not the doc's own structure. Include step-by-step actionable detail when the docs describe a workflow or UI feature.
3. Call out practical limitations and edge cases from the docs.
4. Close with clear guidance: if the feature only partially answers the question, say what else they can do and where.
5. ALWAYS include the docs page URL(s) as markdown hyperlinks at the end of your response, e.g. [Page title](https://docs.getdbt.com/...).
